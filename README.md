# Personal website project

This repository is just for my personal website project on [reio.opromei.ee](https://reio.opromei.ee/).

To keep things simple I have used [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as my development server and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) with [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) as my designing library.

## Running development server

**NB!** Change directory to reio.opromei.ee!

~~~bash
# changing directory to project directory
cd reio.opromei.ee/

# Running Vite development server
npm run dev
~~~

## Building project

**NB!** Change directory to reio.opromei.ee!

~~~bash
# changing directory to project directory
cd reio.opromei.ee/

# Running Vite builder with tsc
# Default out directory is dist/
npm run build
~~~
